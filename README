org-journal-list
================

A package to display sidebar, showing a list of org-notes with preview.

For a preview, please see [screenshot.png].

Installation
------------

You can install with use-package, from MELPA:

    (use-package org-journal-list
        :ensure t
        :config
        (setq org-journal-list-default-directory "~/notes/"))

Or checkout the code and install it locally:

   (use-package org-journal-list
       :load-path "~/your/local/path/to/this/package"
       :config
       (setq org-journal-list-default-directory "~/notes/"))

This will install org-journal-list and set ~/notes as a default journal directory.

Configurations
--------------

* Default directory:
By default, it will be "~/notes/journal/". All of the *.org files in subdirectories
will be listed as well. To change the default directory, you can change the
org-journal-list-default-directory variable:

   (setq org-journal-list-default-directory "/your/custom/path/")

Please note that, if you use "~" as $HOME folder in your path, the full path will
be displayed when the file list displayed. To omit the default path, use
"/Users/<your-name>/" instead of "~" for $HOME.

* Default note suffix:
When you open journal list with org-journal-list--start, the new note buffer will
be created with the name "dd-mm-yyyy.journal.org", you can change the ".journal.org"
part by changing org-journal-list-default-suffix variable:

   (setq org-journal-list-default-suffix ".org")

But you can't change the "dd-mm-yyyy" part, this is intended to let you reopen the
note of the same day at any point after the file created. If you have a different
note-taking workflow, you can just change the new buffer creation behavior, see
the next section.

* Create empty buffer instead of a named one:
By changing org-journal-list-create-temp-buffer to a non-nil value, you will have
an empty org-mode buffer instead of a named one:

   (setq org-journal-list-create-temp-buffer t)

The default directory when you save the buffer will be your journal default directory.
